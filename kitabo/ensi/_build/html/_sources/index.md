## `WebApp Data`

### Dionysus 1, 2, 3
- `Voir`: Faith in what is **not seen**, but what is hoped for, i.e. God's charity
- `Savoir`: Ethan, like the author of a Midsummer Nights Dream, exploits the frenzy & sfumato arising out of mistaken or ambiguous `identities`
- `Pouvoir`: God so loved himself that he created the world and placed man in it, that man's foremost duty would be to love God

### Sing O Muse 4
- `Communication`: These are the Judeo-Christian teachings from the last 3000 years, and they say the very opposite of the Greco-Roman teachings from same period

### Apollo 5, 6
- `Identity`: And thus you have the pagans and heathens, *joir de vivre*, diva & opera vs. hebrews and christians, asceticism, cantor & oratorio 
- `Achievements`: Which of these two has spawned a greater following over the last three millenia? It's a tie: one dominates the arts, the other ethics


           1. Chaos
